
This tool was created to quickly create surf ramps that can be shaped in real time. It works well for 
prototyping surf maps and making complex ramps quick.


How to use:

To create a new ramp goto the top left of unity and select "Tools" then "Procedural Ramp". The ramp 
will be instantiated at 0, 0, 0 in the world.

Select the ramp to edit it.
Modify the ramp properties in the inspector.

You can add or remove segments by clicking "Add Curve" / "Remove Curve" buttons in the inspector.

The "Create Static Mesh" button will make a permanent static copy of the ramp you have selected. Once you 
do this the ramp cannot be edited anymore but the color can be.

Steps control the resolution of the ramp.
